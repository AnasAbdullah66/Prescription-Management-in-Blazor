"Assalamu Alaikum"

I have created here a Masterpage Project for making Prescription.

Please follow this to view project

First give sqlServer name in appsettings.json file 

Then update database by this command = update-database -Context "PrescriptionDbContext"

After that go to sql server and give data in 'MedicalTest' table in 'PrescriptionDb' database.

Run the project. Registration and login first. 

Then select Prescription tab to view data. 

Click 'Add' button to add new data. 

Note: To view data login must.
